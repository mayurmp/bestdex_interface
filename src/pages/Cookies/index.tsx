              Our Privacy and Terms of Service Policies explain our principles when it comes to the collection,
              processing, and storage of your personal information. This policy explains the use of cookies in more
              details, such as what cookies are and how they are used. However, to get a full picture of how we handle
              your privacy this policy should be read together with our Privacy and Terms of Service Policies.

              Cookies are text files, containing small amounts of information, which are downloaded to your browsing
              device, such as your computer, mobile device or smartphone, when you visit our website or use our
              services. Cookies can be recognised by the website that downloaded them â€” or other websites that use the
              same cookies. This helps websites know if the browsing device has visited them before.

              We use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie lasts beyond the
              current session and is used for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing user, so it&#39;s
              easier to return to us and interact with our services. Since a persistent cookie stays in your browser, it
              will be read by us when you return to one of our sites or visit a third-party site that uses our services.
              Session cookies last only as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser
              session).
